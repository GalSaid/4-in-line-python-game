After my self-learning in Python I built a project for the game connect4 that includes 2 games:
1) Game with 2 participants
2) Playing against the computer

Several modules appear in this folder:
1) Board class -> there are all the methods and features related to a game board.
2) AI board class -> this board inherits from a normal board and there are additional methods related only to AI board.
3) Gui part that deals with the initial display and screen that we see and accepting a choice from the user(which game does he want?).
4) The game process(main.py) - link between the logic of the two games and what actually happens in the game.
5) Audio for the start and end game.

The 2 game types have been combined into one game with a choice option.

TO RUN THE GAME ON YOUR LOCAL PC, YOU CAN CLICK ON THE EXE FILE WITHOUT ANY DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED .
