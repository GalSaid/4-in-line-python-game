# 4-in-line
After my self-learning in Python I built a project for the game connect4 that includes 2 games:
1) Game with 2 participants
2) Playing against the computer

<h2>structure</h2>

Several modules appear in this folder:</br>
1) Board class -> there are all the methods and features related to a game board.</br>
2) AI board class -> this board inherits from a normal board and there are additional methods related only to AI board.</br>
3) Gui part that deals with the initial display and screen that we see and accepting a choice from the user(which game does he want?).</br>
4) The game process(main.py) - link between the logic of the two games and what actually happens in the game.</br>
5) Audio for the start and end game.</br></br>

The 2 game types have been combined into one game with a choice option.</br>
<h2>Run</h2>
To run the game on your pc, you can <a href=https://github.com/GalSaid/4-in-line-python-game/blob/a726024f99ef4b431d76d7ea6d469862bdf4f51a/main.exe>download the exe file</a> without any dependencies installed.
